    "text": "Key Concepts\n\nTemperature Anomaly:\n\nDefinition: The difference between the observed temperature and a reference average temperature over a specific period. For example, if the average temperature for a month is 1°C above the long-term average, the temperature anomaly for that month is +1°C.\nPurpose: Anomalies are used instead of absolute temperatures to more clearly identify and analyze deviations from normal conditions, minimizing the effects of natural variability and measurement differences.\n\nLong-Term Average:\n\nDefinition: A baseline temperature calculated over a long period (e.g., 30 years). This baseline is used to compare current temperatures and determine anomalies.\nPurpose: Provides a reference point to understand deviations from typical conditions.\n\nTime Series of Anomalies:\n\nDefinition: A series of temperature anomalies recorded over time (e.g., monthly or annually). This series helps to observe trends and patterns in temperature deviations.\nPurpose: Allows for the analysis of trends (increasing or decreasing temperatures), seasonal variations, and long-term changes in climate.\n\n\n\n\nImportance of Analyzing Temperature Anomalies Over Time\n\nClimate Change Monitoring:\n\nAnalyzing temperature anomalies helps in tracking long-term climate change. Rising anomalies over time are indicative of global warming.\n\nTrend Identification:\n\nDetects patterns and trends in temperature deviations, which can help in understanding the rate and extent of climate change.\n\nExtreme Events:\n\nIdentifies periods of unusual temperature spikes or drops, which may be linked to extreme weather events or other significant climate phenomena.\n\nPolicy and Planning:\n\nProvides essential data for climate models and informs policy decisions related to climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.\n\n\n\n\nExample of Temperature Anomalies Over Time\nTo visualize temperature anomalies over time, you might plot the anomalies on a graph with time on the x-axis and temperature anomalies on the y-axis. This can reveal trends such as:\n\nRising Anomalies: An upward trend indicates increasing temperatures.\nSeasonal Patterns: Regular fluctuations that follow seasonal cycles.\nAbrupt Changes: Sudden spikes or drops that might correspond to significant climatic events or changes in measurement techniques.\n\nBy analyzing temperature anomalies over time, scientists and policymakers can gain insights into how climate is changing and what impact these changes might have on ecosystems and human societies."

    "text": "1. Data Story\nThe code is designed to compare temperature anomalies between the year 2024 and all other years in the dataset. It uses density plots to visualize the distribution of temperature anomalies for these two time periods. By comparing these distributions, you can observe how the temperature anomalies in 2024 differ from the overall historical data.\n\n\n2. Data Analysis Methods\n\nSelection\n\nData Selection: The dataset used is monthly-temperature-anomalies.csv. It includes a ‘Day’ column for dates and a ‘Temperature.anomaly’ column for temperature anomalies.\nTime Period Selection: Data is divided into two groups:\n\n2024: Data for the year 2024.\nAll Time: Data for all other years combined.\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nConversion and Extraction:\n\nThe ‘Day’ column is converted to a Date type to facilitate time-based operations.\nThe ‘Year’ is extracted from the ‘Day’ to filter the data into two groups (2024 and all other years).\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning and Manipulations\n\nFiltering:\n\ndata_2024 contains only the records from the year 2024.\ndata_all_time contains records from all years except 2024.\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\nDensity Plot Creation:\n\nDensity Plot: A density plot is used to show the distribution of temperature anomalies.\nOverlaying Density Plots: Two density plots are overlaid:\n\nAll Time: Distribution of temperature anomalies for all years except 2024.\n2024: Distribution of temperature anomalies specifically for the year 2024.\n\nColor Coding: Different colors are used to distinguish between the two groups:\n\nBlue: All Time\nRed: 2024\n\nLegend: The scale_fill_manual function creates a legend to clarify which color represents which time period.\nLabels and Theme: The plot is labeled and styled minimally for clarity.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nComparison: By comparing the density plots, you can identify differences in the distribution of temperature anomalies between the year 2024 and the historical average.\n\nIf the density for 2024 shifts significantly compared to the ‘All Time’ distribution, it might indicate unusual temperature patterns in 2024.\nIf the densities overlap significantly, the temperature anomalies in 2024 are consistent with historical trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Selection\nObjective: The goal is to visualize global temperature anomalies for 2024 using a world map.\n\n\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nData Loading:\n\nLibraries: dplyr for data manipulation, stringr for string operations, ggplot2 for visualization, and maps for geographic data.\nData is loaded from a CSV file containing monthly temperature anomalies.\n\nInitial Data Inspection:\n\nConvert the ‘Day’ column to a Date type.\nExtract the year from the ‘Day’ column for aggregation purposes.\n\n\n\n3. Data Cleaning and Manipulations\nData Aggregation:\n\nFilter data for the year 2024.\nGroup data by region (Entity) and calculate the mean temperature anomaly for each region.\n\nData Cleaning:\n\nAdjust region names to match those in the world map dataset. This involves renaming regions to ensure consistency between datasets.\n\nMerge Data:\n\nMerge the aggregated temperature anomaly data with the world map data based on the region.\n\n\n\n4. Visualization\nMap Preparation:\n\nDefine a clean, minimalistic theme for the map to ensure the focus remains on the data.\n\nPlotting:\n\nUse ggplot2 to create a world map, plotting temperature anomalies with a color gradient.\nThe map uses the geom_polygon() function to draw the world map and scale_fill_distiller() to apply a color palette representing temperature anomalies.\n\n\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nVisual Insights: The final map provides a visual representation of temperature anomalies across different regions of the world for 2024. Colors indicate the magnitude of temperature anomalies, with a diverging color palette highlighting differences from the average temperature.\n\nCode Summary:\n\nLibraries: Loaded necessary libraries for data manipulation, string operations, and visualization.\nData Handling: Data was cleaned, aggregated, and merged with world map data.\nPlotting: Generated a world map with a color gradient to represent temperature anomalies.\n\nThe plot effectively shows temperature anomalies globally, giving a clear view of how different regions compare in terms of temperature deviations from the norm for 2024.\n4o mini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Analysis Methods\n\nLoading Libraries:\n\ntidyverse: A collection of R packages for data manipulation and visualization.\nggplot2: For creating graphics.\nggiraphExtra: Provides additional ggplot2 features (though not explicitly used in this code).\n\nLoading Data:\n\nThe data is loaded from a CSV file located at /Users/user/Desktop/Final_project/monthly-temperature-anomalies.csv.\n\nData Aggregation:\n\nData is grouped by Entity (likely countries) and the mean temperature anomaly is calculated for each entity using mean(Temperature.anomaly, na.rm = TRUE).\nThe results are sorted in descending order of the mean temperature anomaly.\n\nTop 10 Countries Selection:\n\nThe code selects the top 10 countries with the highest mean temperature anomalies using top_n(10, mean_anomaly).\n\nVisualization:\n\nA circular barplot is created to visualize the top 10 countries with the highest temperature anomalies.\n\n\n\n\nData Story\nThe analysis aims to identify and visualize the countries with the highest average temperature anomalies. By aggregating the temperature anomaly data per country and focusing on the top 10 countries with the highest mean values, this analysis highlights which countries are experiencing the most significant deviations from average temperatures. The circular barplot provides a clear and engaging visual representation of these top 10 countries.\n\n\nData Selection\n\nData Source: Monthly temperature anomalies.\nSelection Criteria: Countries are selected based on the mean temperature anomaly. Only the top 10 countries with the highest mean anomalies are considered for the visualization.\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nThe primary EDA step here involves aggregating data to find the mean temperature anomaly per country and sorting the countries to identify the top performers. This initial exploration helps in understanding which countries have the most significant temperature deviations.\n\n\n\nData Cleaning and Manipulations\n\nMissing Values: na.rm = TRUE is used in the mean() function to handle any missing values in the temperature anomaly data.\nAggregation: Data is aggregated to calculate mean temperature anomalies by country.\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\nPlot Type: A circular barplot is chosen to represent the top 10 countries with the highest mean temperature anomalies.\nPlot Details:\n\nBars: Represent the mean temperature anomaly for each country.\nColor: Bars are filled with a “cornflowerblue” color.\nCoordination: coord_polar(theta = \"x\") creates the circular effect.\nTheme: theme_minimal() for a clean look, with rotated x-axis text for better readability.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe circular barplot effectively highlights the countries most affected by temperature anomalies, providing a visual emphasis on the top 10 entities. This visualization can be useful for understanding which regions are experiencing the most significant temperature deviations and may help in further analyses or policy discussions related to climate change."
