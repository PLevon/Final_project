Explore the data to see how global temperatures have deviated from long-term averages.\nThis visualization shows the average temperature anomalies across the globe from 1940 to the present. Each point represents the deviation from the long-term average temperature for a given month. The trend line highlights the overall warming pattern, illustrating the increase in temperature anomalies over the decades."
